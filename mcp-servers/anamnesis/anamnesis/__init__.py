"""
Anamnesis - Semantic code analysis and intelligence.

Python port of In-Memoria (Rust core), providing:
- Tree-sitter based AST parsing for 11 languages
- Semantic concept extraction
- Pattern learning and prediction
- Codebase analysis and blueprinting

The name "Anamnesis" (Greek: ἀνάμνησις) refers to Plato's concept of
recollection - the idea that learning is really remembering knowledge
the soul already possesses. Fitting for a codebase intelligence tool
that helps developers "remember" patterns across their code.
